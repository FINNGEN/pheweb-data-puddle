<p>
  This table contains p &lt; 1e-3 associations from loss-of-function gene burden tests in FinnGen data freeze 6 (2,861 endpoints).
  The following VEP-annotated variants are considered: frameshift, splice donor, stop gained, splice acceptor.
  Association tests were run with SAIGE using the same covariates as in the regular GWAS.
  The dosage for each gene was calculated as the probability of carrying a minor allele in a LoF variant in the gene (1 - prod(prob(major)) where prob(major) is the genotype probability of the major allele for each variant).
